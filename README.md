# classify_age(age)
I wrote this code by creating a function, classify_age(age), that classifies an individual's age according to user input. I employed a try-except block in order to deal with the wrong inputs and avoid error whenever the user provides a non-integer input. The function has conditional statements to categorize the user as a Child, Teen, Adult, or Senior according to his/her age.
